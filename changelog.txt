v0.3.2:
    -   Modified the dispatcher a bit. We only want the request to propagate from middlewares,
    since there can be requests that take longer to process, and we don't want overlapping responses.
    Therefore, we end the dispatching process if we encounter a route that is not a middleware.
    If you want to use a middleware, use dispatcher.use, not dispatcher.on.
