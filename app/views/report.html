      <h2>1. Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Universal Tool Storage is a web application that gives all its users the possibility to store complex files of a
        large size through another cloud service provider such as: DropBox, Google Drive, OneDrive (others may be added
        in time). This document describes how <i>Universal Tool Storage</i> works and should be used.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="introduction" role="doc-introduction">
      <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The current digital age is marked by our reliance on the cloud. Multiple applications are used in a large
        diversity that defines
        the ides of cloud storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Universal Storage Tool</i> is the application that helps users managing multiple cloud storage services from
        a single place. The application allows all its users to upload, download and archive files. Even if a file is
        lage and can not be uploaded due to its size, <i>Universal Storage Tool</i> will offer the possibility to
        fragment this file in smaller pieces and upload them in different cloud storage such that they will fit. Of
        course, if the user wants to download it, will be reconstructed to its initial form and delivered to him/her.
      </p>
      <section typeof="sa:MaterialAndMethods" id="motivation">
        <h3>2.1. Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          A conducted study shows how "more than half of people use at least 3 different storage services". "Almost
          all people believe that their data habits have changed due to personal Cloud Storage. A majority of them are
          now using the cloud as their primary data storage. More than 50% of surveyed people use a free or paid
          limited storage plan.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section typeof="sa:MaterialAndMethods" id="purpose">
        <h3>2.2. Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          Universal Storage Tool has, as a first purpose, to offer to its users a simple and clean platform for
          managing multiple cloud services by linking them to an account. Thus, the users will not need to worry about
          the details, just focus on what matter the most for them: their data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second purpose of this application is efficiency and time saving for our clients, a better and faster
          way to storage files across multiple cloud storage services.

    <section id="structure">
      <h2>3. Structure</h2>
      <p>
        Universal Storage Tool is structured based on functionalities that are provided to its users. The
        functionalities provided by the application include manipulating and computing different operations on files
        that belong to a logged user. In the following section, all those functionalities will be presented.
      </p>
      <section id="functionalities">
        <h3>3.1. Functionalities</h3>
        <p>
          Following a natural order in witch they were implemented, <i>Universal Storage Tool</i> offers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>User registration and authentication.</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Linking a cloud service account</em> that does not exist in the current UnST account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Displaying via UI the user account details</em>: user based info and statistics regarding the amount of
            used space on every cloud service
            linked to the current account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Displaying via UI all the files</em> from all linked cloud storage services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Uploading files</em> in a classic manner (in a single linked cloud application) or by fragmenting it
            and uploading it in multiple
            linked cloud services in case is too large to fit in any linked cloud application.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Downloading an existent file that was uploaded</em> in a classic manner if it was uploaded in the
            same way, or by reconstructing
            all its fragments from every linked cloud application and putting them together and after that
            downloading it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Archiving files</em> using a preset software for this purpose.

      <section id="ui-components">
        <h3>3.2. UI components</h3>
        <p>
          <i>Universal Storage Tool's</i> structure is comprised by a number of HTML pages, each having different visual
          components, which we will explain in the current section.
        </p>
        <section id="index-page">
          <h4>3.2.1. Index page</h4>
          <p>
            The index page is the main page the user will see. It will provide navigation functionalities and will
            allow the user to see all the files associated with his account, choose to upload a new file and see how
            much space he/she has left in total.
          </p>
          <section id="nav-bar">
            <h5>3.2.1.1 Navigation Bar</h5>
            <p>
              The Navigation Bar is the UI element providing navigation functionality to the user. It includes an
              image with the project's logo, which if clicked redirects to the Index page, and more links to the right,
              to all the other HTML pages of the website.
            </p>
            <p>
              The responsiveness is provided through the flexbox containers and media queries for small displays.
              If the display is narrower than 678 pixels, the elements in the right will not be visible anymore.
              In their place, a menu icon will appear, and by clicking it the links to the other pages will be
              displayed in a drop menu fashion.
            </p>
            <p>
              This element appears on all pages, for a more standardized navigation system, except for the Report
              page, since that one must comply with the Scholarly HTML format.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section id="side-menu">
            <h5>3.2.1.2 Side Menu</h5>
            <p>
              The side menu is one of the two main elements of the body, making one of the two grid columns the
              body is made of. It allows access all the time to the button for adding a new file and the statistics for
              the available space in total.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the display is narrower than 678 pixels, its width shrinks to 42 pixels, and instead of the
              elements it contained, only a menu button will be visible. Upon clicking the button, the side menu will
              revert to its original width, allowing the user to select one of the possible actions.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section id="main-view">
            <h5>3.2.1.3 Main View</h5>
            <p>
              The main view is the other grid element of the body. This is where files and folders will be
              visible, allowing the user to download them or confirm that his uploads did succeed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The elements inside this container will be loaded through JavaScript, through AJAX calls using the
              fetch API, and will be displayed using a simple float left. This way, regardless of the display
              width, all files will be visible, since it is scrollable.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section id="login-register-page">
            <h4>3.2.2. Login/Register Page</h4>
            <p>
              This page provides the functionality for user login and registration. Both the "Login" and "Register"
              functionalities will be on the same page.
              The presentation of the page consist of a form with two text box inputs: username and password and two
              submit buttons: login and register. If a submit button was clicked, a validation of the input data,
              username and password, will be executed firstly: username needs to have minimum 6 and maximum 16
              alphabetic and numeric characters and password needs to have minimum 8 and maximum 32 alphabetic and
              numeric characters.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on what button was clicked, the corresponding action will be done. In case of a "Login" button, the
              user will request to login as a user with username and password inserted in the input fields of the login
              form, respectively a user registration will be requested if the pressed button is "Register".
            </p>
            <p>
              A successful response from the server will redirect the user to the "Home" Page, otherwise the user
              will be restricted to remain in the "Login/Register" page.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section id="account-page">
            <h4>3.2.3. Account Page</h4>
            <p>
              The "Account" page offers information regarding the current logged in user: username, the registration
              date, his/her linked cloud applications and a status bar for each one showing the amount of space already
              in use.
            </p>
            <p>
              This page also allows users to edit or delete their account and also add a new link to another cloud
              storage application.
