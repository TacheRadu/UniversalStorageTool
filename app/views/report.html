                Universal Tool Storage is a web application that gives all its users the possibility to store complex files of a large size
                thru another cloud services such as:Box, DropBox, Google Drive, etc. This document describes how Universal Tool Storage works and
                should be used.

            <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The current digital age is marked by our reliance on the cloud. Multiple applications are used in a large diversity that defines
                the ides of cloud storage.
            </p>

            <p>
                Universal Storage Tool is the application that helps users managing multiple cloud storage services from a single place. The application
                allows all its users to upload, download and archive files. Even if a file is lage and can not be uploaded due to its size, Universal
                Storage Tool will offer the possibility to fragment this file in smaller pieces and upload them in different cloud storage
                such that they will fit. Of course, if the user wants to download it, will be reconstructed to its initial form and delivered to him.

                <h3>2.1. Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    A conducted study shows how "more than half of people use at least 3 different storage services". "Almost all people believe that
                    their data habits have changed due to personal Cloud Storage. A majority of them are now using the cloud as their primary data
                    storage. More than 50% of surveyed use a free or paid limited storage plan".

                <h3>2.2. Purpose</h3>
                <p>
                    Universal Storage Tool has, as a first purpose, to offer to its users a simple and clean platform for managing multiple
                    cloud services by linking them to an account. So, all the clients can depend on abstractions and not on details.

                </p>

                <p>
                    The second purpose of this application is efficiency and time saving for our clients, a better and faster way to storage files
                    across multiple cloud storage services.

            <p>
                Universal Storage Tool is structured based on functionalities that are provided to its users. This application functionalities evolves
                around manipulating and computing different operations on files that belong to a specific user. In the following section, will be
                presented all those functionalities.

                        <em>Showing via UI the user account details</em>: user based info and statistics regarding the amount of used space on every cloud service

                    <li>
                        <em>Uploading files</em> in a classic manner (in a single linked cloud application) or by fragmenting it and uploading it in multiple
                        linked cloud services in case is too large to fit in any linked cloud application.

                        <em>Downloading an existent file that was uploaded</em> in a classic manner if it was uploaded in the same way, or by reconstructing
                        all its fragments from every linked cloud application and putting them together and after that downloading it.
