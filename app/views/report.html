            <h2>1. Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                Universal Tool Storage is a web application that gives all its users the possibility to store complex files of a large size
                thru another cloud services such as:Box, DropBox, Google Drive, etc. This document describes how Universal Tool Storage works and
                should be used.

            <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The current digital age is marked by our reliance on the cloud. Multiple applications are used in a large diversity that defines
                the ides of cloud storage.
            </p>
            <p>
                A conducted study shows how "more than half of people use at least 3 different storage services". "Almost all people believe that
                their data habits have changed due to personal Cloud Storage. A majority of them are now using the cloud as their primary data
                storage. More than 50% of surveyed use a free or paid limited storage plan".
            </p>

            <p>
                Universal Tool Storage is the application that helps users managing multiple cloud storage services from a single place. The application
                allows all its users to upload, download and archive files. Even if a file is lage and can not be uploaded due to its size, Universal
                Tool Storage will offer the possibility to fragment this file in smaller pieces and upload them in different cloud storage
                such that they will fit. Of course, if the user wants to download it, will be reconstructed to its initial form and delivered to him.

            <p>
                Universal Storage Tool is structured based on functionalities that are provided to its users. This application functionalities evolves
                around manipulating and computing different operations on files. In the following section, will be presented all those functionalities

                    Following a natural order in witch they were implemented, UST presents the next functionalities:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                    <li>
                        <em>Linking a cloud service account</em> that does not exist in the current UST account.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Showing via UI the user account details</em>: user based info and statistics regarding the amount of used space on every cloud service
                        linked to the current account.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Showing via UI all the files</em> from all linked cloud storage services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Uploading files</em> in a classic manner (in a single linked cloud application) or by fragmenting it and uploading it in multiple
                        linked cloud services in case is too large to fit in any linked cloud application.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Downloading an existent file that was uploaded</em> in a classic manner if it was uploaded in the same way, or by reconstructing
                        all its fragments from every linked cloud application and putting them together and after that downloading it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Archiving files</em> using a preset software for this purpose.
